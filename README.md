# Salary Prediction App using Machine Learning and Streamlit

Excited to unveil my latest creation: a Salary Predictor App that leverages the power of Linear Regression to estimate salaries based on years of experience. This project combines data-driven insights with an intuitive interface to make predictions accessible to everyone.

  # Insights:

  # What I Build:

  - Used a Simple Linear Regression model to predict salary based on years of experience. The dataset ('Salary_Data.csv') is split into training and test sets, and the model is trained on the training set. The 
    performance of the model is visualized on both the training and test sets using scatter plots and regression lines.
  - Created Numerical Data Processing Pipeline
  - Model Building Pipeline
  - Prediction Pipeline
  - Trained a Linear Regression model to understand the correlation between experience and salary trends.
  - Designed interactive visualizations to make results both engaging and informative.
  - Deployed the model as a sleek, web-based tool using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

  # Key Features:

 ðŸ’¡ Simple and clean interface for user inputs.
 
 ðŸ’¡ Instant, data-backed salary predictions.
 
 ðŸ’¡ Visual tools to explore the modelâ€™s insights and performance.

  # Technologies in Action
  - Python: Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
  - Deployment: Streamlit for an interactive UI and Pickle for efficient model handling

This project highlights how machine learning can turn raw data into actionable insights while offering practical tools for everyday use. Itâ€™s been a rewarding journey bringing this idea to life and learning along the way!
